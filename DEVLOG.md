**Project Start**

- *Added the required dependencies for the project. I might add more later if needed*.
- *Started building the models to see what I'll need to do next*.
- *Added CORS to control and secure cross-origin server requests*.
- *Started the server to test if the connection to MongoDB was working correctly*.
- *Created the user registration route and it's working perfectly*.
- *User authentication is done, I used JWT tokens for security measures, including multi-platform support*
- *The refresh token route is fully implemented, and I added some extra lines of code to ensure user security*.
